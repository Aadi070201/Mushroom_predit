Feature: User interface interaction
    In order to enhance the accuracy and usability of mushroom edibility predictions
    As an individual seeking reliable mushroom safety information
    I want an advanced interface that streamlines data entry and provides detailed feedback

Scenario :- Validate the inputs in real time
            Given I am using the mushrooom edibility prediction interface
            When I give the inputs to the interface
            Then The system uses the inputs and provides real time feedback on invalid or missing entries

Scenario :- Displaying prediction results with help of graphs or visualization
            Given I have entered the mushroom characteristics
            When the prediction is completed
            Then provide a dashboard with prediction outcome and also provide graphs or the prediction score
